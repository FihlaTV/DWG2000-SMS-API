* IMPORTANT NOTE *

Dinstar people change their API like they change their clothes. 
Since I only tested the code with two of their models I cannot assure it will work for other models. Let me know in 
what model it's failing and I will try to fix it.

Overview
=========

This project aims to implement the protocol for sending/receiving SMS's with Dinstra's DWG2000 GSM gateway.
The project is still in a early state but I'll be working on it as much as possible.
There is an official support for Microsoft Windows but the manufacturer lacks of a version for *nix operating systems.

How to compile
==============

- Clone the repo or download the sources.
- Go to the source directory and run: make && make install.

The sources will compile as a shared object and you will probably need
a executable project to use the library. If that is the case, please 
checkout the client in one on my repositories.

an email, I will be answering as soon as I can.
