This project aims to implement the protocol for sending/receiving SMS's with Dinstra's DWG2000 GSM gateway.
The project is still in a very early state but I'll be working on it as much as possible.
There is an official support for Microsoft Windows but the manufacturer lacks of a version for *nix operating systems.

TODO list:

1. Finish the implementation.
2. Add a C# binding for the library.
